# Project Description:

The "circom-schnorr-verify" project aims to create a cryptographically secure proof using the circom library and zk-SNARK technology to verify the statement "I know a Schnorr signature associated with a public key belonging to a group with at least two public keys." The proof leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs to demonstrate knowledge of a Schnorr signature without revealing any sensitive information.

# How It Works:

1. Schnorr Signature Generation: The project implements the Schnorr signature generation algorithm, which takes the private key as input and generates the corresponding public key. The user can sign specific messages using this private key to generate Schnorr signatures. (#notsureyet)

2. Schnorr Signature Verification: The circuit includes the Schnorr signature verification process. Given a Schnorr signature, a message, and the associated public key, the circuit can verify the validity of the signature.

3. Group Verification: The circuit includes logic to verify if the provided public key belongs to a group with at least two other public keys. This ensures that the public key is part of a larger group, providing additional security guarantees.

4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: The circom library is utilized to generate zk-SNARKs for the above processes. These zero-knowledge proofs allow the prover to demonstrate knowledge of the Schnorr signature and the belonging to the group without revealing any private information.

# Usage: #TODO

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed to run the project successfully. This includes circom, snarkjs, and any other necessary libraries. 

2. Generating the Proof: Use the provided circuit definition and data inputs to generate the zk-SNARK proof. The proof generation process should not disclose any private information about the signer's private key.

3. Verification: After generating the proof, anyone can independently verify its validity by using the provided public key, the signature, and the zk-SNARK proof.
